By passing saliva sample thru 130nm filter to remove particles larger than 120nm covid 19 virus particles and concentrating resulting fluid to very small 1 mm2 area of 80nm filter. Pores in this small area of 80nm  filter should be clogged up fast raising filter air resistance. Due to high virus density 5.2 log10 ml saliva of infected person should clogg filter much faster than healthy person. Test is setup in such way that act of compressor automatically turning off after reaching threshold PSI value will indicate high count of particles larger than 80nm of being present in measured filter area.
